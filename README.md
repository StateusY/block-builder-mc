# block-builder-mc
Just a small project to to make a script that generates custom Minecraft blocks using datapacks.


The block configuration is inspired by [maybejakes](https://github.com/maybejake)'s [Crop and Kettle](https://github.com/maybejake/crop-and-kettle) block implementation.

The block is made up of three main parts:
- The texture (an item display)
- The interaction (interaction entities)
- The collision (a barrier block)
